It leverages materials and process competencies of soft matter and nanostructured material synthesis, processing, integration and characterization and device fabrication and characterization to enable the development of high performance, lightweight, low cost energy flexible electronic concepts. Specific research thrusts include, but are not limited to, the development of strain tolerant materials and devices, advanced processing approaches for integration of flex devices into robust packages such as for flexible/stretchable electronics, and characterization of such materials and devices for mechanical reliability \n\nin AF unique extreme environments. This research is expected to lead to flexible/stretchable electrode materials for extremely high rate energy storage, novel materials for next generation thin film transistors, nanostructured dielectrics for pulse power and wide operating temperature capacitors, ultra-lightweight and flexible photovoltaics, integrated micropower sources, wearable sensors, multifunctional responsive materials systems, flexible batteries and electrodes for human integration and structural power, and novel direct write and 3-D printing approaches to enable integration of multifunctional materials elements onto non-traditional substrates. Computational tools are utilized to guide material and device design and to predict material and device performance in efforts to accelerate or support understanding, development and delivery of flexible and soft matter material solutions to current and future AF systems. Specific projects of interest could include, but are not limited to, the following: 1) Development of printing approaches for thin film transistors, 2) New materials chemistries, device architectures, and mechanical characterization of flexible/stretchable battery concepts, 3) Nanodielectrics for high energy density capacitors, 4) Integration approaches for structural electronics composites, and 5) materials and processing methodologies and\nstructure/property relationships in flexible electronic devices including power, sensing, and communication functions (NAICS Code 541712).\neligibility: 1. Eligible Offeror: This is an unrestricted solicitation. Small businesses are encouraged to propose.\n2. Cost Sharing or Matching: Cost Sharing is not required.\n3. Federally Funded Research and Development Centers: The following guidance is provided for Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) contemplating submitting a proposal, as either a prime or subcontractor. FAR 35.017-1(c)(4) prohibits an FFRDC from competing with any non-FFRDC concern in response to a Federal agency request for proposal for other than the operation of an FFRDC (with exceptions stated in DFARS 235.017-1(c)(4)). There is\nno regulation prohibiting an FFRDC from responding to a solicitation. However, the FFRDC's sponsoring agency must first make a determination that the effort being proposed falls within the purpose, mission, general scope of effort, or special competency of the FFRDC, and that determination must be included in the FFRDC's proposal. In addition, AFRL must make a determination that the work proposed would not place the FFRDC in direct competition with domestic private industry. Only after these determinations are made, would a determination be made concerning the FFRDC's eligibility to receive\nan award.\n4. Government Agencies: If a Government agency is interested in performing work, contact the Program Manager identified in the BAA. If those discussions result in a mutual interest to pursue your agency's participation, the effort will be pursued independent of this announcement.\n5. Other:\na. Foreign participation: Foreign Disclosure Review will be accomplished on each white paper submission selected for funding; therefore foreign participation may or may not be allowed.\nb. Notice to Foreign-Owned Firms: Such firms are asked to immediately notify the Contracting Officer before deciding to respond to this announcement. Foreign contractors should be aware that restrictions might apply which could preclude their\nparticipation in this acquisition.\nc. There are no limits on the number of white papers an offeror may submit.\nd.
