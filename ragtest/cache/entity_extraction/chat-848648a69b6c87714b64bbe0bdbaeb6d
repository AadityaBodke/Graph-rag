Additional information on prior work in this area, descriptions of available equipment, use of base support (if desired), data and facilities and resumes of personnel who will be participating in this effort should also be included as attachments to the technical proposal. This volume shall include a SOW detailing the technical tasks proposed to be accomplished under the proposed effort and suitable for contract incorporation. Do not include any proprietary information in the SOW. Refer to the BAA Guide for Industry referenced above to assist in SOW preparation.\n(3) Any questions concerning the technical proposal or SOW preparation shall be referred to the Technical POC\n\nc. Cost/Business Proposal:\n(1) Separate the proposal into a business section and cost section.\na) The business section should contain all business aspects to the proposed contract, such as type of contract, any exceptions to terms and conditions of the announcement including the model contract, any information not technically related, etc. Provide rationale for exceptions.\nb) Associate Contractor Agreements: Associate Contractor Agreements (ACAs) are agreements between contractors\nworking on Government contracts that require them to share information, data, technical knowledge, expertise, or\nresources. The contracting officer may require ACAs when contractors working on separate Government contracts must\ncooperate, share resources or otherwise jointly participate in working on contracts or projects. Prime contractor to\nsubcontractor relationships do not constitute ACAs. For each award, the contracting officer will identify associate\ncontractors with whom agreements are required.\nc) Identify any technical data that will be delivered with less than unlimited rights.\nd) Subcontracting Plans: For efforts to exceed $700,000,Subcontracting Plans shall be submitted in the cost/business\nproposal. Reference FAR 19.704, DFARS 219.704, and AFFARS 5319.704(a)(1) for subcontracting plan requirements.\nSmall business concerns are exempt from this requirement. If an IDIQ contract arrangement is anticipated, the basis for the subcontracting plan should reflect the entire ceiling amount.\ne) Limitations on Pass-Through Charges: As prescribed in FAR 15.408(n)(1) & 15.408(n)(2), provisions 52.215-22,\n\"Limitations on Pass Through Charges- Identification of Subcontract Effort (Oct 2009),\" apply.\nf) Completed Certifications and Representations (Section K) are due with the full technical and cost proposal. Certifications and Representations (Section K) will be provided to offerors requested to submit a full technical and cost proposal. Offerors may also be required to submit updated or supplemental Certifications and Representations based on the specifics of their proposal.\ng) If an offeror proposes the use of Government Furnished Property (GFP), other than GFP identified in the BAA, the offer must specifically identify each piece of GFP in the Cost/Business Proposal, and propose and substantiate a rental\ncost for evaluation purposes in accordance with FAR 45.202. Include the following information in the proposal:\n(i) A list describing all Government property that the offeror or its subcontractors propose to use on a rent-free basis.\nThe list shall identify the accountable contract under which the property is held and the authorization for its use (from\nthe contracting officer having cognizance of the property); (ii)The dates during which the property will be used and, for\nany property that will be used concurrently in performing two or more contracts, the amounts of the respective uses\nin sufficient detail to support prorating the rent; \n(iii) The amount of rent that would otherwise be charged in accordance with FAR 52.245-9, Use and Charges; and\n(iv)The voluntary consensus standard or industry leading practices and standards to be used in the management of\nGovernment property, or existing property management plans, methods, practices, or procedures for accounting for\nproperty.\nii Cost Element Breakdown: Clear, concise, and accurate cost proposals reflect the offeror's financial plan for accomplishing the effort contained in the technical proposal. As a part of its cost proposal, the offeror shall submit the information outlined below, together with supporting breakdowns. All direct costs (labor, material, travel, computer, etc.) as well as labor and overhead rates should be provided by contractor fiscal year (CFY). Detailed cost element breakdowns by Government Fiscal Year or calendar year are not required. The supporting schedules may include\nsummary level estimating rationale used to generate the proposed costs. The cost element breakdown(s) should include\nthe following if applicable.\na) Direct Labor: Direct labor should be detailed by number of labor hours by category of labor.\nb) Labor and Overhead Rates: Direct labor hours, with their applicable rates, must be broken out and the bases used clearly identified. The source of labor and overhead rates and all pricing factors should be identified. For instance, if a Forward Pricing Rate Agreement (FPRA) is in existence, that should be noted, along with the Administrative Contracting Officer's (ACO's) name and telephone number. If the rates are based on current experience in your organization, provide the historical base used and clearly identify all escalation, by year, applied to derive the proposed rates. If computer usage is determined by a rate, identify the basis used and rationale used to derive the rate.\nc) Material/Equipment: List all material/equipment items by type and kind with associated costs, and advise if the costs are based on vendor quotes, data and/or engineering estimates; provide copies of vendor quotes and/or catalog pricing data.\n d) Subcontractor\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
