This aspect of our strategy is critical, because despite founders of color having high-potential business models, they are commonly overlooked for growth capital often due to implicit biases and a lack of cultural understanding of their products and potential markets.\n\nWe will target anchor institution strategies, corporate initiatives and shifts in government policy that create more opportunities for firms owned by people of color to generate revenue and scale operations. Additionally, we continue to value targeted support systems for people of color that nurture entrepreneurs growth through mentors, capital, skill development and information.\neligibility: We accept letters of inquiry from nonprofit organizations that believe there is strong alignment between their work and Surdnas funding priorities.\n\n__ Selection Criteria\n\nImprovements to Investing\nWe will support efforts that change the lens through which investment decisions are made and will explore opportunities to change the racial and gender dynamic of investors by supporting early-stage fund managers of color and funding leadership development opportunities designed to diversify the finance sector.\n\nInclusive Institutional Change\nWe will support initiatives that aim to shift the policies that guide procurement within large institutions to be more inclusive.\n\nProfessional Development Programs\nWe will support projects that build professional networks and organizations that help people of color scale their businesses and more fully participate in high-growth sectors.\ncategories_display: {\"Social Sciences\": {\"Economics\": null, \"Political Science\": null}}\nlimited_grant_info: nan\nuser_categories: Economics;Political Science\nsubmit_date: 2018-09-27 03:40:17\nis_limited: 0\nsite_categories: nan\ncost_sharing: nan\ngrant_source_url: https://surdna.org/strategy/business-start-up-growth/\ndeadlines: None\namounts: None\nall_types: Other\nall_applicant_types: Not for Individual; Organization; Non-profit; Not for Commercial\nlocations: None\nsponsors: \n      \next_grant_id: None\nreplaces: nan\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
