Search below to see if your zip code falls within our range.\n\nELIGIBLE ORGANIZATIONS\n\nInnovation Grants aim to help undiscovered organizations at a point in their evolution where $20,000 still makes a meaningful contribution towards becoming sustainable long-term. If your organization has more than $1million in annual revenue or receive any grants over $100,000 from government entities or large philanthropic organizations, it has likely outgrown RMYF grants.\n\nOnly organizations that meet all of the following criteria are eligible for Innovation Grants:\n\n- Are US-based organizations with IRS nonprofit status.\n- Operate in one of these geographic areas: Boston MA, Los Angeles, CA, Milwaukee WI, San Francisco CA, and Washington DC.\n- Offer innovative programs or services designed help underprivileged youth reach their full potential. Innovative is defined as \"uncommon, untested or otherwise unconventional\" In other words, RMYF funds programs or services that are outside of current customary practices. Innovative services RMYF has funded include the following:\n- Credit union savings projects\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
