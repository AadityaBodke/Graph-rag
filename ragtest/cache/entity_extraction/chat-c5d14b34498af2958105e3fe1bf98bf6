General: The FIRST STEP requests a White Paper (to include a Quad Chart) and a rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost. The White Paper shall include a discussion of the nature and scope of the research and the offeror's proposed technical approach. The Government will review the White Papers in accordance with the FIRST STEP review criteria, set forth in Section V. below. Based on this review, the Government will determine which of them have the potential to best meet the Air Force's needs. Offerors will be notified of the disposition of their White Paper. It is anticipated that\nGovernment review of the White Papers submitted will take 30 working days. Those offerors submitting White Papers assessed as meeting Air Force needs will be asked to submit a technical and cost proposal. Those offerors not requested to submit a technical and cost proposal will be notified but may, however, still elect to submit a technical and cost proposal. An offeror submitting a proposal without first submitting a White Paper will not be eligible for an award. The cost of preparing White Papers in response to this BAA is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting or any other contract; however, it may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost as specified in FAR 31.205-18.\nb. Page Limitation: The White Paper shall be limited to 4 pages plus 1 page for the Quad Chart for a total submission of 5 pages. The White Paper shall be prepared and submitted in Word format and be in the standard 10- point business font Arial. Character spacing must be \"normal,\" not condensed in any manner. Pages shall be double-spaced (must use standard double-space function in Microsoft Word), double-sided (each side counts as one page), 8.5 by 11 inches, with at least one-inch margins on both sides, top and bottom. Lines between text lines must also be 10-point. All text, including text in tables and charts, must adhere to all font size and line spacing requirements listed herein. Font and line spacing requirements do not have to be followed for illustrations, flowcharts, drawings, and diagrams. These exceptions shall not be used to circumvent formatting requirements and page count limitations by including lengthy narratives in\nsuch items. Pages associated with the White Paper shall be numbered starting with the cover page being Page 1, and the last page being Page 5. The page limitation covers all information including indices, photographs, foldouts (counted as 1 page for each 8.5 by 11 portion) tables, charts, appendices, attachments, resumes, etc. (except the Quad Chart, which is treated separately, and is limited to one page). The Government will not consider pages in excess of these limitations. Offerors should submit 1 original and 2 hard copies of the White Paper via mail to the Contracting POC, identified in Section VII. A CD with the WORD version of your White Paper must be submitted with the hard copies of the White Paper, and must match the hard copy.\nc. Format: The White Paper will be formatted as follows: (1) Section A: Title of Program, Name of Company, Company's Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number, Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number, Contracting POC and Technical POC with appropriate telephone numbers, fax numbers, and email addresses for the POCs; (2) Section B: Period of Performance and Task Objectives; (3) Section C: Technical Summary; (4) Section D: Quad Chart and (5) Section E: Cost of Task (Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM)).\nd.
