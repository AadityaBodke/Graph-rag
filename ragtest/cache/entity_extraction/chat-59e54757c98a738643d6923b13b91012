We provide a high level of service to our funders and grantees by conducting our work in a manner that is collaborative, transparent, and accountable. We respond promptly to the needs and interests of our partners by staying abreast of changing policy and social landscapes. We educate grantmakers and non-profits organizations on the important role intermediaries play in the philanthropic sector, and endeavor to share our knowledge with the broader field. In carrying out this vision, we ultimately hope to change the way philanthropy works.\n\nOUR VALUES\nBorealis Philanthropy is guided by the following set of principles:\n\nResponsiveness: We proactively monitor the rapidly changing nature of the work we fund and allocate resources accordingly.\nTransparency: We make information about our services and our knowledge publicly available and accessible to philanthropy.\nComplexity: We recognize the complexity of issues and support organizations working at the intersections of a wide variety of societal challenges.\nPhilanthropic advocacy: We seek to educate non-profits and grantmakers on the critical role that intermediaries play within philanthropy.\nExpertise: We bring a deep level of knowledge and experience in grantmaking and the respective fields in which we fund.\nDiversity: Our staff and board demonstrate the lived experiences we fund.\n\nBackground\n\nThe REACH Fund seeks to build the capacity of the nonprofit sector to address issues of racial and intersectional equity and inclusion and to address the gap between interest and capacity in the sector to pursue racial equity. The Fund will invest in supporting and lifting up the work of those who are innovating and developing promising practices.\n\nBy matching nonprofits with racial equity practitioners offering technical support on how to apply a racial equity lens towards dismantling institutional racism, build race conscious organizations and leadership, and design internal and external strategy, policy, and cultural change, the REACH Fund aims to:\n\nhelp meet the increased demand and need from the nonprofit sector for technical support;\nincrease funding to support the being and doing of racial equity in the nonprofit and philanthropic sectors; and\ncreate efficiency and opportunity for sharing the accelerators and barriers for sector level progress towards racial equity.\nWe believe that when nonprofits know where to go and how to move forward their own practice of racial equity, they will be better able to end inequities in their work.\n\nThe REACH Fund is a donor collaborative and learning community based at Borealis Philanthropy and currently includes support from the Barr Foundation, the Bush Foundation, the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, the Evelyn and Walter Haas, Jr. Fund, the Ford Foundation, the Grove Foundation, the Heising-Simons Foundation, the James Irvine Foundation, the Meyer Memorial Trust, the NoVo Foundation, the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation, and the S.D. Bechtel, Jr. Foundation.\n\nThe REACH Fund is one component of our racial equity work at Borealis Philanthropy. While the REACH Fund focuses on the nonprofit sector, the Racial Equity in Philanthropy (REP) Fund focuses on changing grantmaker behavior. The REP Funds vision is to promote grantmaking strategies that prioritize structural change and ending racial disparities as the norm in philanthropy.
