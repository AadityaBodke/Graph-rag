Each year BACF asks charities that serve the area to present grant requests for funds within their individual missions. The primary focus of the grant process is to provide seed money for new or expanding projects that follow our mission statement. We will also consider requests for unusual or unexpected Capital Improvements. \n \nThe Foundation will judge and make grants annually from its permanent funds based on the the degree of impact to the area population in School District 200 and the Barrington Area Council of Governments (BACOG) including the greater of the two. Our formula balances the local needs and at a minimum preserves the corpus of net assets.  \n \nFunding, not programming, is the basic function of the Foundation.\neligibility: Local not-for-profit organizations are encouraged to attend and learn about our grant process and the Barrington Area Community Foundation.\ncategories_display: {\"Social Sciences\": {\"Political Science\": {\"Government\": null}}, \"Urbanism\": {\"Urban Studies\": {\"Communities\": null}}}\nlimited_grant_info: nan\nuser_categories: Social Sciences;Political Science;Government;Communities\nsubmit_date: 2018-12-04 23:05:21\nis_limited: 0\nsite_categories: nan\ncost_sharing: nan\ngrant_source_url: https://barringtonareacommunityfoundation.org/bacf-grant-information/\ndeadlines: \n      \namounts: \n      \nall_types: Equipment/Facility/Organization\nall_applicant_types: Not for Individual; Organization; Non-profit\nlocations: None\nsponsors: \n      \next_grant_id: None\nreplaces: nan\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
