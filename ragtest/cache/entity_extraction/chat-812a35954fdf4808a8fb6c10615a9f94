Eligible Offeror: This is an unrestricted solicitation. Small businesses are encouraged to propose.\n2. Cost Sharing or Matching: Cost Sharing is not required.\n3. Federally Funded Research and Development Centers: The following guidance is provided for Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) contemplating submitting a proposal, as either a prime or subcontractor. FAR 35.017-1(c)(4) prohibits an FFRDC from competing with any non-FFRDC concern in response to a Federal agency request for proposal for other than the operation of an FFRDC (with exceptions stated in DFARS 235.017-1(c)(4)). There is\nno regulation prohibiting an FFRDC from responding to a solicitation. However, the FFRDC's sponsoring agency must first make a determination that the effort being proposed falls within the purpose, mission, general scope of effort, or special competency of the FFRDC, and that determination must be included in the FFRDC's proposal. In addition, AFRL must make a determination that the work proposed would not place the FFRDC in direct competition with domestic private industry. Only after these determinations are made, would a determination be made concerning the FFRDC's eligibility to receive\nan award.\n4. Government Agencies: If a Government agency is interested in performing work, contact the Program Manager identified in the BAA. If those discussions result in a mutual interest to pursue your agency's participation, the effort will be pursued independent of this announcement.\n5. Other:\na. Foreign participation: Foreign Disclosure Review will be accomplished on each white paper submission selected for funding; therefore foreign participation may or may not be allowed.\nb. Notice to Foreign-Owned Firms: Such firms are asked to immediately notify the Contracting Officer before deciding to respond to this announcement. Foreign contractors should be aware that restrictions might apply which could preclude their\nparticipation in this acquisition.\nc. There are no limits on the number of white papers an offeror may submit.\nd. You may be ineligible for award if all requirements of this solicitation are not met on the white paper (and later proposal).\ncategories_display: {\"Science\": null, \"Technology\": null}\nlimited_grant_info: nan\nuser_categories: Science;Technology\nsubmit_date: 2017-07-27 21:37:58\nis_limited: 0\nsite_categories: nan\ncost_sharing: nan\ngrant_source_url: https://www.grants.gov/custom/viewOppDetails.jsp?oppId=283134\ndeadlines: None\namounts: \n      \nall_types: Research Project\nall_applicant_types: Government; Commercial; Organization\nlocations: None\nsponsors: \n      \next_grant_id: None\nreplaces: nan\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
