The overarching goal of the Education Crisis Response is to: Expand enrollment in appropriate, protective and relevant educational options for the girls, boys, and youth that are affected by violence in Northeastern Nigeria.Activities will provide targeted assistance for the girls, boys, and youth that are affected by violence in Northeastern Nigeria, and ensure that children and youth have continued access to an instructional routine in Adamawa and the buffer States of Bauchi and Gombe (with other States to be determined as needs require and conditions permit). Within this goal, the Education Crisis Response will address the following problems: Expected large increase in drop-out rates in affected States Over-crowding of classrooms and learning spaces due to influx of displaced populations Limited access for displaced children Shortage of qualified teachers and instructional materials for formal and non-formal education Children traumatized by violence and abductions, and families fear of sending their children to school Marginalization of girls and children with disabilities Rising tensions between host communities and displaced populations.Programs may have a maximum duration of 36 months. Priority will be given to applications that can be launched rapidly. USAID anticipates awarding approximately two to six awards ranging anywhere from minimum grant size of $300,000 and a maximum grant size of $15,000,000 made available either to one grantee, multiple grantees, or no grantees depending on the quality of the applications and availability of funds.Subject to the availability of funds, USAID intends to provide the funding in the total range of approximately $30,000,000. USAID/Nigeria reserves the right to make multiple grants, cooperative agreements, or no awards at all through this APS.
