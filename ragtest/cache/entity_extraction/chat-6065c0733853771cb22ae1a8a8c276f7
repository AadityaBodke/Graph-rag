It offers doctoral candidates who are funded by the NSF in the framework of its Graduate Research Fellows Program (GRFP) to make research stays at scientific institutions in partner countries. The FWF in 2014 has joined this cooperation. FWF finances the salary of US doctoral candidates for the time of their research stay in Austria. All scientists who have received FWF project funding (including SFB project part leaders and DK faculty members) in the last 5 years (since January 2014).\n\nProgramme aim\nResearch stays of US doctoral candidates at Austrian research institutes\n\nDuration\n10  12 months\neligibility: Programme aim\nResearch stays of US doctoral candidates at Austrian research institutes\n\nAddressees\n\nUS doctoral candidates: doctoral candidates on reserve participating in the NSF the GRFP programme.
