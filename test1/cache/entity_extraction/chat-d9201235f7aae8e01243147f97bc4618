The GLC seeks to promote a better understanding of all aspects of the institution of slavery from the earliest times to the present. Argiro Fellows may study the global history of racism, slavery, and abolition, with an emphasis on its modern-day forms, impact, and eradication and recovery efforts. Scholars from all disciplines, both traditional academics as well as writers, researchers, and artists without academic institutional affiliation, are encouraged to apply. This new fellowship is sponsored by a generous gift from Vincent Argiro, Yale, '77, modern antislavery activist and entrepreneur.\neligibility: Applicants MUST have received the Ph.D. prior to the beginning of their appointment, or possess equivalent experiences. Both established and younger scholars are invited to apply. This is a residential fellowship and Fellows are expected to spend the majority of their time in residence at Yale, from August 2022 through May 2023. The residency requirement is contingent on current public health policies implemented by Yale University, the State of Connecticut, and the Fellow's home institution. In addition to working on their own research project, the Fellow is expected to teach one course related to their research and hold related office hours for students. Ideally, the Fellow also will complete a significant publication during their residency. The Fellow is expected to participate in the intellectual life of the GLC and the larger Yale community, and to acknowledge the support of the GLC and the MacMillan Center in publications and lectures that stem from research conducted during the fellowship term. The fellow is expected to offer one public presentation during their tenure at Yale and to record an audio interview for a podcast. The Fellow will engage in the GLC s modern slavery initiative in all ways suitable to their scholarly and public interests.\ncategories_display: {\"Area Studies\": null, \"Humanities\": null}\nlimited_grant_info: nan\nuser_categories: Area Studies;Humanities\nsubmit_date: 2018-12-17 21:34:13\nis_limited: 0\nsite_categories: nan\ncost_sharing: nan\ngrant_source_url: https://glc.yale.edu/Fellowships/human-trafficking-and-modern-day-slavery-fellowship\ndeadlines: \n      \namounts: None\nall_types: Fellowship/Scholarship/Dissertation\nall_applicant_types: Not for Organization; Senior Researcher; Early Career Investigator; Not for Graduate; Not for Undergraduate; Individual\nlocations: \n      \nsponsors: \n      \next_grant_id: None\nreplaces: nan\n\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>ARGIRO FELLOWSHIP IN THE STUDY OF MODERN SLAVERY<|>FELLOWSHIP, GRANT<|>The Argiro Fellowship is offered by the Gilder Lehrman Center for the Study of Slavery, Resistance, and Abolition at Yale University, focusing on modern slavery and its historical context.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GILDER LEHRMAN CENTER<|>ORGANIZATION, ACADEMIC INSTITUTION<|>The Gilder Lehrman Center is part of the MacMillan Center for International and Area Studies at Yale University, promoting research on slavery and its impacts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YALE UNIVERSITY<|>ORGANIZATION, ACADEMIC INSTITUTION<|>Yale University is a prestigious institution that hosts the Gilder Lehrman Center and offers various fellowships and academic resources.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VINCENT ARGIRO<|>PERSON, DONOR<|>Vincent Argiro is a Yale alumnus and modern antislavery activist who sponsored the Argiro Fellowship.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTERFOLIO<|>PLATFORM, APPLICATION SYSTEM<|>Interfolio is the online platform used for submitting application materials for the Argiro Fellowship.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARGIRO FELLOWSHIP IN THE STUDY OF MODERN SLAVERY<|>GILDER LEHRMAN CENTER<|>The Argiro Fellowship is offered by the Gilder Lehrman Center, which manages the fellowship program focused on modern slavery.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GILDER LEHRMAN CENTER<|>YALE UNIVERSITY<|>The Gilder Lehrman Center is part of Yale University, contributing to its academic and research initiatives.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VINCENT ARGIRO<|>ARGIRO FELLOWSHIP IN THE STUDY OF MODERN SLAVERY<|>Vincent Argiro is the sponsor of the Argiro Fellowship, providing funding and support for the program.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARGIRO FELLOWSHIP IN THE STUDY OF MODERN SLAVERY<|>INTERFOLIO<|>Applications for the Argiro Fellowship must be submitted through the Interfolio platform.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n#############################\n\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\ntext: id: 286296\nurl: https://www.grantforward.com/grant?grant_id=286296\namount_info: Grants are combined program and general support and will range from $50,000 - $150,000\nsite_grant_type: nan\nmodified_date: 2018-11-14 03:01:52\napplication_url: https://borealisphilanthropy.org/download/5498/\ntitle: Racial Equity to Accelerate Change Fund\nall_titles: Racial Equity to Accelerate Change Fund\nsubmission_info: HOW TO APPLY\n\n1.

We provide a high level of service to our funders and grantees by conducting our work in a manner that is collaborative, transparent, and accountable. We respond promptly to the needs and interests of our partners by staying abreast of changing policy and social landscapes. We educate grantmakers and non-profits organizations on the important role intermediaries play in the philanthropic sector, and endeavor to share our knowledge with the broader field. In carrying out this vision, we ultimately hope to change the way philanthropy works.\n\nOUR VALUES\nBorealis Philanthropy is guided by the following set of principles:\n\nResponsiveness: We proactively monitor the rapidly changing nature of the work we fund and allocate resources accordingly.\nTransparency: We make information about our services and our knowledge publicly available and accessible to philanthropy.\nComplexity: We recognize the complexity of issues and support organizations working at the intersections of a wide variety of societal challenges.\nPhilanthropic advocacy: We seek to educate non-profits and grantmakers on the critical role that intermediaries play within philanthropy.\nExpertise: We bring a deep level of knowledge and experience in grantmaking and the respective fields in which we fund.\nDiversity: Our staff and board demonstrate the lived experiences we fund.\n\nBackground\n\nThe REACH Fund seeks to build the capacity of the nonprofit sector to address issues of racial and intersectional equity and inclusion and to address the gap between interest and capacity in the sector to pursue racial equity. The Fund will invest in supporting and lifting up the work of those who are innovating and developing promising practices.\n\nBy matching nonprofits with racial equity practitioners offering technical support on how to apply a racial equity lens towards dismantling institutional racism, build race conscious organizations and leadership, and design internal and external strategy, policy, and cultural change, the REACH Fund aims to:\n\nhelp meet the increased demand and need from the nonprofit sector for technical support;\nincrease funding to support the being and doing of racial equity in the nonprofit and philanthropic sectors; and\ncreate efficiency and opportunity for sharing the accelerators and barriers for sector level progress towards racial equity.\nWe believe that when nonprofits know where to go and how to move forward their own practice of racial equity, they will be better able to end inequities in their work.\n\nThe REACH Fund is a donor collaborative and learning community based at Borealis Philanthropy and currently includes support from the Barr Foundation, the Bush Foundation, the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, the Evelyn and Walter Haas, Jr. Fund, the Ford Foundation, the Grove Foundation, the Heising-Simons Foundation, the James Irvine Foundation, the Meyer Memorial Trust, the NoVo Foundation, the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation, and the S.D. Bechtel, Jr. Foundation.\n\nThe REACH Fund is one component of our racial equity work at Borealis Philanthropy. While the REACH Fund focuses on the nonprofit sector, the Racial Equity in Philanthropy (REP) Fund focuses on changing grantmaker behavior. The REP Funds vision is to promote grantmaking strategies that prioritize structural change and ending racial disparities as the norm in philanthropy.
