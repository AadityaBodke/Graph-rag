The GLC seeks to promote a better understanding of all aspects of the institution of slavery from the earliest times to the present. Argiro Fellows may study the global history of racism, slavery, and abolition, with an emphasis on its modern-day forms, impact, and eradication and recovery efforts. Scholars from all disciplines, both traditional academics as well as writers, researchers, and artists without academic institutional affiliation, are encouraged to apply. This new fellowship is sponsored by a generous gift from Vincent Argiro, Yale, '77, modern antislavery activist and entrepreneur.\neligibility: Applicants MUST have received the Ph.D. prior to the beginning of their appointment, or possess equivalent experiences. Both established and younger scholars are invited to apply. This is a residential fellowship and Fellows are expected to spend the majority of their time in residence at Yale, from August 2022 through May 2023. The residency requirement is contingent on current public health policies implemented by Yale University, the State of Connecticut, and the Fellow's home institution. In addition to working on their own research project, the Fellow is expected to teach one course related to their research and hold related office hours for students. Ideally, the Fellow also will complete a significant publication during their residency. The Fellow is expected to participate in the intellectual life of the GLC and the larger Yale community, and to acknowledge the support of the GLC and the MacMillan Center in publications and lectures that stem from research conducted during the fellowship term. The fellow is expected to offer one public presentation during their tenure at Yale and to record an audio interview for a podcast. The Fellow will engage in the GLC s modern slavery initiative in all ways suitable to their scholarly and public interests.\ncategories_display: {\"Area Studies\": null, \"Humanities\": null}\nlimited_grant_info: nan\nuser_categories: Area Studies;Humanities\nsubmit_date: 2018-12-17 21:34:13\nis_limited: 0\nsite_categories: nan\ncost_sharing: nan\ngrant_source_url: https://glc.yale.edu/Fellowships/human-trafficking-and-modern-day-slavery-fellowship\ndeadlines: \n      \namounts: None\nall_types: Fellowship/Scholarship/Dissertation\nall_applicant_types: Not for Organization; Senior Researcher; Early Career Investigator; Not for Graduate; Not for Undergraduate; Individual\nlocations: \n      \nsponsors: \n      \next_grant_id: None\nreplaces: nan\n\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>ARGIRO FELLOWSHIP IN THE STUDY OF MODERN SLAVERY<|>FELLOWSHIP, GRANT<|>The Argiro Fellowship is offered by the Gilder Lehrman Center for the Study of Slavery, Resistance, and Abolition at Yale University, focusing on modern slavery and its historical context.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GILDER LEHRMAN CENTER<|>ORGANIZATION, ACADEMIC INSTITUTION<|>The Gilder Lehrman Center is part of the MacMillan Center for International and Area Studies at Yale University, promoting research on slavery and its impacts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YALE UNIVERSITY<|>ORGANIZATION, ACADEMIC INSTITUTION<|>Yale University is a prestigious institution that hosts the Gilder Lehrman Center and offers various fellowships and academic resources.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VINCENT ARGIRO<|>PERSON, DONOR<|>Vincent Argiro is a Yale alumnus and modern antislavery activist who sponsored the Argiro Fellowship.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTERFOLIO<|>PLATFORM, APPLICATION SYSTEM<|>Interfolio is the online platform used for submitting application materials for the Argiro Fellowship.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARGIRO FELLOWSHIP IN THE STUDY OF MODERN SLAVERY<|>GILDER LEHRMAN CENTER<|>The Argiro Fellowship is offered by the Gilder Lehrman Center, which manages the fellowship program focused on modern slavery.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GILDER LEHRMAN CENTER<|>YALE UNIVERSITY<|>The Gilder Lehrman Center is part of Yale University, contributing to its academic and research initiatives.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VINCENT ARGIRO<|>ARGIRO FELLOWSHIP IN THE STUDY OF MODERN SLAVERY<|>Vincent Argiro is the sponsor of the Argiro Fellowship, providing funding and support for the program.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARGIRO FELLOWSHIP IN THE STUDY OF MODERN SLAVERY<|>INTERFOLIO<|>Applications for the Argiro Fellowship must be submitted through the Interfolio platform.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n#############################\n\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\ntext: id: 291004\nurl: https://www.grantforward.com/grant?grant_id=291004\namount_info: Grants do not exceed 10% of an organizations total annual operating budget.\nsite_grant_type: nan\nmodified_date: 2018-12-04 22:33:04\napplication_url: http://www.meyerhoffcharitablefunds.org/discover/our-application-process\ntitle: Meyerhoff Family Charitable Funds - Baltimore\nall_titles: Meyerhoff Family Charitable Funds - Baltimore\nsubmission_info: The application process begins with our staff requesting a letter of inquiry from your organization.

Baltimores great strengths include outstanding cultural institutions and universities, along with diverse neighborhoods. To build on and complement these strengths, we work to anchor middle class communities by supporting them through grants to Jewish institutions, cultural and educational organizations, libraries, green spaces, and community groups in various neighborhoods.\n\nWe are also mindful of our responsibility to help support those striving to move out of poverty by funding organizations that provide food assistance, job training and low cost recreation to our citizens.\neligibility: Striving to fulfill the Jewish commitment to Tzedakah, we choose to fund organizations working to sustain the quality of life for middle class families in Baltimore City, and the Jewish community locally, nationally, and in Israel.\n\nThe Funds transition in our Jewish/Israel giving portfolio continues in 2017 as we further the rigorous planning that started last year. Our process has renewed our sense of purpose and helped us to determine that we will focus on engaging and educating young Jewish families in Baltimore. In Israel, we will support civil and shared society throughout the country and young families in the periphery.\n\nWhile we continue to work on this strategic portfolio, we will be contacting those organizations whose work directly aligns with our refined areas of focus.
