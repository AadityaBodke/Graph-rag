The GLC seeks to promote a better understanding of all aspects of the institution of slavery from the earliest times to the present. Argiro Fellows may study the global history of racism, slavery, and abolition, with an emphasis on its modern-day forms, impact, and eradication and recovery efforts. Scholars from all disciplines, both traditional academics as well as writers, researchers, and artists without academic institutional affiliation, are encouraged to apply. This new fellowship is sponsored by a generous gift from Vincent Argiro, Yale, '77, modern antislavery activist and entrepreneur.\neligibility: Applicants MUST have received the Ph.D. prior to the beginning of their appointment, or possess equivalent experiences. Both established and younger scholars are invited to apply. This is a residential fellowship and Fellows are expected to spend the majority of their time in residence at Yale, from August 2022 through May 2023. The residency requirement is contingent on current public health policies implemented by Yale University, the State of Connecticut, and the Fellow's home institution. In addition to working on their own research project, the Fellow is expected to teach one course related to their research and hold related office hours for students. Ideally, the Fellow also will complete a significant publication during their residency. The Fellow is expected to participate in the intellectual life of the GLC and the larger Yale community, and to acknowledge the support of the GLC and the MacMillan Center in publications and lectures that stem from research conducted during the fellowship term. The fellow is expected to offer one public presentation during their tenure at Yale and to record an audio interview for a podcast. The Fellow will engage in the GLC s modern slavery initiative in all ways suitable to their scholarly and public interests.\ncategories_display: {\"Area Studies\": null, \"Humanities\": null}\nlimited_grant_info: nan\nuser_categories: Area Studies;Humanities\nsubmit_date: 2018-12-17 21:34:13\nis_limited: 0\nsite_categories: nan\ncost_sharing: nan\ngrant_source_url: https://glc.yale.edu/Fellowships/human-trafficking-and-modern-day-slavery-fellowship\ndeadlines: \n      \namounts: None\nall_types: Fellowship/Scholarship/Dissertation\nall_applicant_types: Not for Organization; Senior Researcher; Early Career Investigator; Not for Graduate; Not for Undergraduate; Individual\nlocations: \n      \nsponsors: \n      \next_grant_id: None\nreplaces: nan\n\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>ARGIRO FELLOWSHIP IN THE STUDY OF MODERN SLAVERY<|>FELLOWSHIP, GRANT<|>The Argiro Fellowship is offered by the Gilder Lehrman Center for the Study of Slavery, Resistance, and Abolition at Yale University, focusing on modern slavery and its historical context.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GILDER LEHRMAN CENTER<|>ORGANIZATION, ACADEMIC INSTITUTION<|>The Gilder Lehrman Center is part of the MacMillan Center for International and Area Studies at Yale University, promoting research on slavery and its impacts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YALE UNIVERSITY<|>ORGANIZATION, ACADEMIC INSTITUTION<|>Yale University is a prestigious institution that hosts the Gilder Lehrman Center and offers various fellowships and academic resources.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VINCENT ARGIRO<|>PERSON, DONOR<|>Vincent Argiro is a Yale alumnus and modern antislavery activist who sponsored the Argiro Fellowship.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTERFOLIO<|>PLATFORM, APPLICATION SYSTEM<|>Interfolio is the online platform used for submitting application materials for the Argiro Fellowship.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARGIRO FELLOWSHIP IN THE STUDY OF MODERN SLAVERY<|>GILDER LEHRMAN CENTER<|>The Argiro Fellowship is offered by the Gilder Lehrman Center, which manages the fellowship program focused on modern slavery.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GILDER LEHRMAN CENTER<|>YALE UNIVERSITY<|>The Gilder Lehrman Center is part of Yale University, contributing to its academic and research initiatives.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VINCENT ARGIRO<|>ARGIRO FELLOWSHIP IN THE STUDY OF MODERN SLAVERY<|>Vincent Argiro is the sponsor of the Argiro Fellowship, providing funding and support for the program.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARGIRO FELLOWSHIP IN THE STUDY OF MODERN SLAVERY<|>INTERFOLIO<|>Applications for the Argiro Fellowship must be submitted through the Interfolio platform.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n#############################\n\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\ntext: id: 276344\nurl: https://www.grantforward.com/grant?grant_id=276344\namount_info: Pilot and Feasibility studies without significant preliminary data may also be submitted and can request up to total $150,000 USD per year for one year (including 10 % indirect costs).\nsite_grant_type: nan\nmodified_date: 2018-10-03 22:07:05\napplication_url: http://grantcenter.jdrf.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Localized-Immunomodulation-BCR-RFA.pdf\ntitle: Localized Immunomodulation in Beta Cell Replacement- Pilot and Feasibility (PNF)\nall_titles: Localized Immunomodulation in Beta Cell Replacement- Pilot and Feasibility (PNF)\nsubmission_info: LETTER OF INTENT \nProspective applicants should submit a Letter of Intent (LOI) online via RMS360 (http://jdrf.smartsimple.us) to be considered for a full proposal.

Pancreatic islet transplantation has been efficacious in improving metabolic control, preventing severe hypoglycemia, and improving quality of life in patients with medically unstable T1D. Despite significant progress in the development of alternative renewable sources of insulin producing cells to overcome the shortage of donor tissue, major scientific and technical challenges remain that must be addressed before beta cell replacement is widely incorporated into the clinical management of established T1D. One key limitation is the need for systemic administration of immunosuppressive drugs to protect the cell graft from the recipients immune response.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe advent of the Edmonton protocol signified a major breakthrough in clinical islet transplantation by significantly improving outcomes in patients that underwent the procedure as reflected by stable glycemia, reduction in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and elimination of hypoglycemia for several years.1,2 However, most of these patients still failed to maintain insulin independence for more than 5 years due to graft failure. Moreover, the use of immunosuppressive drugs is associated with serious adverse side effects and can impair beta cell function.3-5 Alternative approaches being explored for providing immune protection include encapsulation of cells in permselective membranes that allow exchange of nutrients, glucose, and insulin but block immune cells and other immune effectors from recognizing the graft.6-13 Although progress has been promising, the foreign body reaction and ensuing fibrotic encapsulation of implanted materials paired with limitations on mass transfer and nutrient delivery remain a challenge.\n\nMore recently, the emerging field of immuno-engineering has come to the forefront of efforts to develop technologies to control the patients innate and adaptive immune responses.14-24 These approaches employ various strategies targeting mechanisms of immune cell recognition and activation which could be exploited to direct the host response to implanted materials and/or cells towards a wound healing and/or tolerogenic response, as opposed to an inflammatory and/or effector response. Local immunomodulation at the graft site is highly desirable, as it could obviate the need for harsh and burdensome systemic immunosuppression regimens and perhaps even encapsulation barriers. Therefore, JDRF wishes to support research into novel strategies for localized modulation of the host response to implanted materials and development of immunomodulatory therapeutics to provide graft protection at the transplant site leading to long-term graft function.\neligibility: ELIGIBILITY \nApplicants for SRAs must hold an M.D., D.M.D., D.V.M., Ph.D., or equivalent and have a faculty position or equivalent at a college, university, medical school, or other research facility.
