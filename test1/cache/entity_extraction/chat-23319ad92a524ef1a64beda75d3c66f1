Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

The GLC seeks to promote a better understanding of all aspects of the institution of slavery from the earliest times to the present. Argiro Fellows may study the global history of racism, slavery, and abolition, with an emphasis on its modern-day forms, impact, and eradication and recovery efforts. Scholars from all disciplines, both traditional academics as well as writers, researchers, and artists without academic institutional affiliation, are encouraged to apply. This new fellowship is sponsored by a generous gift from Vincent Argiro, Yale, '77, modern antislavery activist and entrepreneur.\neligibility: Applicants MUST have received the Ph.D. prior to the beginning of their appointment, or possess equivalent experiences. Both established and younger scholars are invited to apply. This is a residential fellowship and Fellows are expected to spend the majority of their time in residence at Yale, from August 2022 through May 2023. The residency requirement is contingent on current public health policies implemented by Yale University, the State of Connecticut, and the Fellow's home institution. In addition to working on their own research project, the Fellow is expected to teach one course related to their research and hold related office hours for students. Ideally, the Fellow also will complete a significant publication during their residency. The Fellow is expected to participate in the intellectual life of the GLC and the larger Yale community, and to acknowledge the support of the GLC and the MacMillan Center in publications and lectures that stem from research conducted during the fellowship term. The fellow is expected to offer one public presentation during their tenure at Yale and to record an audio interview for a podcast. The Fellow will engage in the GLC s modern slavery initiative in all ways suitable to their scholarly and public interests.\ncategories_display: {\"Area Studies\": null, \"Humanities\": null}\nlimited_grant_info: nan\nuser_categories: Area Studies;Humanities\nsubmit_date: 2018-12-17 21:34:13\nis_limited: 0\nsite_categories: nan\ncost_sharing: nan\ngrant_source_url: https://glc.yale.edu/Fellowships/human-trafficking-and-modern-day-slavery-fellowship\ndeadlines: \n      \namounts: None\nall_types: Fellowship/Scholarship/Dissertation\nall_applicant_types: Not for Organization; Senior Researcher; Early Career Investigator; Not for Graduate; Not for Undergraduate; Individual\nlocations: \n      \nsponsors: \n      \next_grant_id: None\nreplaces: nan\n\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>ARGIRO FELLOWSHIP IN THE STUDY OF MODERN SLAVERY<|>FELLOWSHIP, GRANT<|>The Argiro Fellowship is offered by the Gilder Lehrman Center for the Study of Slavery, Resistance, and Abolition at Yale University, focusing on modern slavery and its historical context.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GILDER LEHRMAN CENTER<|>ORGANIZATION, ACADEMIC INSTITUTION<|>The Gilder Lehrman Center is part of the MacMillan Center for International and Area Studies at Yale University, promoting research on slavery and its impacts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YALE UNIVERSITY<|>ORGANIZATION, ACADEMIC INSTITUTION<|>Yale University is a prestigious institution that hosts the Gilder Lehrman Center and offers various fellowships and academic resources.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VINCENT ARGIRO<|>PERSON, DONOR<|>Vincent Argiro is a Yale alumnus and modern antislavery activist who sponsored the Argiro Fellowship.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTERFOLIO<|>PLATFORM, APPLICATION SYSTEM<|>Interfolio is the online platform used for submitting application materials for the Argiro Fellowship.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARGIRO FELLOWSHIP IN THE STUDY OF MODERN SLAVERY<|>GILDER LEHRMAN CENTER<|>The Argiro Fellowship is offered by the Gilder Lehrman Center, which manages the fellowship program focused on modern slavery.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GILDER LEHRMAN CENTER<|>YALE UNIVERSITY<|>The Gilder Lehrman Center is part of Yale University, contributing to its academic and research initiatives.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VINCENT ARGIRO<|>ARGIRO FELLOWSHIP IN THE STUDY OF MODERN SLAVERY<|>Vincent Argiro is the sponsor of the Argiro Fellowship, providing funding and support for the program.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARGIRO FELLOWSHIP IN THE STUDY OF MODERN SLAVERY<|>INTERFOLIO<|>Applications for the Argiro Fellowship must be submitted through the Interfolio platform.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n#############################\n\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\ntext: id: 276345\nurl: https://www.grantforward.com/grant?grant_id=276345\namount_info: Each application may request up to $200,000 per year (including up to 10% indirect costs), for up to two years.\nApplicants should discuss with JDRF Staff (see below) when proposing projects with increased scope (time, budget), especially in the case of clinical research.\nsite_grant_type: nan\nmodified_date: 2018-10-03 22:07:14\napplication_url: http://grantcenter.jdrf.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Novel_strategies_RFA_8.23.18_FINAL.pdf\ntitle: Novel Adjunctive Therapeutic Strategies to Improve Metabolic Control in Type 1 Diabetes\nall_titles: Novel Adjunctive Therapeutic Strategies to Improve Metabolic Control in Type 1 Diabetes\nsubmission_info: LETTER OF INTENT \nProspective applicants should submit a LOI online via RMS360 (http://jdrf.smartsimple.us) to be considered for a full proposal request.

Toward this goal, JDRF invites applications to pursue preclinical or clinical studies to identify or validate novel targets for T1D metabolic control. Additionally, we invite applications to pursue clinical investigation of T1D pathophysiology toward the future identification and validation of novel targets.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nT1D is characterized by the loss of insulin-producing beta cells and consequential metabolic sequela induced by high levels of blood glucose. Insulin therapy, while absolutely essential, is insufficient for most people with T1D to achieve optimal glycemic control and other metabolic outcomes. Thus, adjunct therapies that complement insulin action are critical. Although some validated type 2 diabetes (T2D) drugs (such as GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT inhibitors) show clinical efficacy in T1D, additional therapies designed specifically for T1D pathophysiology promise further advances in metabolic control. This RFA is intended to advance the development of adjunctive therapies rooted in T1D biology.\neligibility: Applications may be submitted by domestic and foreign non-profit organizations, public and private, such as universities, colleges, hospitals, laboratories, units of state and local governments, and eligible agencies of the federal government. Applicants must hold an M.D., D.M.D., D.V.M., Ph.D., or equivalent and have a faculty position or equivalent at a college, university, medical school, or other research facility. Please note that applications from for-profit entities or industry collaborations with academia may be submitted to this RFA; however, additional information will be requested from for-profit entities if a full application is invited.\n\nThere are no citizenship requirements for this program.
