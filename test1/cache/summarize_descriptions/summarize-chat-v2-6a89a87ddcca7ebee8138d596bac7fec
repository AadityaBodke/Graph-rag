{"result": "FLEXIBLE ELECTRONICS refers to a category of electronic devices characterized by their ability to be bent, flexed, and stretched, which distinguishes them from traditional rigid electronics. These devices are developed using advanced materials and innovative processes within the ARFEM research area. The lightweight nature of flexible electronics opens up new applications across various fields, enhancing their versatility and potential for integration into diverse technologies.", "input": "\nYou are an expert in Community Development and Research Funding Analysis.
