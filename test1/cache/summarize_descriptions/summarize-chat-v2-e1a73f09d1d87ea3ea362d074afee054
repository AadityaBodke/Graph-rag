{"result": "The Government plays a crucial role in the funding ecosystem by evaluating proposals submitted by Offerors. This evaluation process is essential for determining which proposals may receive funding or be awarded contracts. The Government assesses the quality and viability of the proposals to make informed decisions regarding financial support and contractual agreements.
