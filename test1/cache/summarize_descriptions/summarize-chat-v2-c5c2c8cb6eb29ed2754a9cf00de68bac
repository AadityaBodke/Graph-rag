{"result": "A Subcontractor is defined as an individual or organization that is engaged by a primary contractor, also known as the Offeror, to execute specific tasks or services within the framework of a larger project. This role is crucial in the execution of contracts, as subcontractors often bring specialized skills or services that complement the primary contractor's capabilities. They may be external entities that provide essential services or materials, and their involvement typically necessitates the submission of cost proposals and analyses, particularly in the context of government contracts. Overall, subcontractors play a vital role in the successful delivery of contracted work by contributing their expertise and resources to fulfill specific project requirements.", "input": "\nYou are an expert in Community Development and Research Funding Analysis.
