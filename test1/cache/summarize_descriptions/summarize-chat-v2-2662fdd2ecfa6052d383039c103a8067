{"result": "The term \"Subcontractor\" refers to an individual or organization that is engaged by a primary contractor, also known as the Offeror, to execute specific tasks or services as part of a larger project. Subcontractors play a crucial role in the execution of contracts, often bringing specialized skills or services that complement the primary contractor's capabilities. Their involvement typically necessitates the submission of cost proposals and analyses, particularly in the context of government contracts. Subcontractors may provide various services or materials, and their engagement is essential for fulfilling the requirements outlined in the main contract. Overall, subcontractors serve as external entities that enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of project delivery within the broader contractual framework.", "input": "\nYou are an expert in Community Development and Research Funding Analysis.
