{"result": "A White Paper is a formal and detailed document submitted by offerors in response to a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA). It outlines the proposed technical approach, objectives, methodologies, and cost estimates for a research project or contract. This document serves as a preliminary proposal that delineates the nature and scope of the research, providing essential information for evaluation by government entities. The White Paper is a critical first step in the application process for funding, as it allows offerors to present their research strategies and financial considerations, which may lead to potential selection for government funding based on the solicitation.", "input": "\nYou are an expert in Community Development and Research Funding Analysis.
