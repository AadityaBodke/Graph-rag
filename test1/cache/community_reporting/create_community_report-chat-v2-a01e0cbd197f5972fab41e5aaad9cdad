This role will involve mapping out relationships among key stakeholders, including academic institutions, nonprofit organizations, and for-profit entities, to identify collaborative opportunities and funding sources. The analyst will also assess the impact of funding mechanisms on diversity and inclusion within the research community, particularly for underrepresented groups.\n\nThe report generated by the analyst will be used to inform decision-makers about significant developments in the funding landscape, potential partnerships, and the implications of funding strategies on community engagement and research outcomes. The analysis will include a review of eligibility criteria, application processes, and funding priorities, ensuring that the insights provided are actionable and relevant to stakeholders in the research and development domain.. The content of this report includes an overview of the community's key entities and relationships.\n\n# Report Structure\nThe report should include the following sections:\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific. When possible, include representative named entities in the title.\n- SUMMARY: An executive summary of the community's overall structure, how its entities are related to each other, and significant points associated with its entities.\n- REPORT RATING: A float score between 0-10 that represents the relevance of the text to research and development funding, grant application processes, and community development, with 1 being trivial or irrelevant and 10 being highly significant, impactful, and actionable in advancing research initiatives and funding opportunities.\n- RATING EXPLANATION: Give a single sentence explanation of the rating.\n- DETAILED FINDINGS: A list of 5-10 key insights about the community. Each insight should have a short summary followed by multiple paragraphs of explanatory text grounded according to the grounding rules below.
