You've established a mindful approach to your daily professional practice and, as a next step, you re working to mindfully integrate ethics to build a safe, rewarding, and successful practice.

In your essay:

1.    Discuss how you will make the Code of Ethics a living document in your daily practice.

    -    Principle IV: Individuals shall uphold the dignity and autonomy of the professions, maintain collaborative and harmonious interprofessional and intraprofessional relationships, and accept the professions' self-imposed standards.
        -    Rule R: Individuals shall comply with local, state, and federal laws and regulations applicable to professional practice, research ethics, and the responsible conduct of research.
3.    Using the selected Principle and Rule
