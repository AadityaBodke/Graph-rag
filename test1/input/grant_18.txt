description: The Bernard F. and Alva B. Gimbel Foundation, Inc. was incorporated in 1943 as a private, family foundation. The Foundations donors had wide ranging philanthropic interests and the Foundations original giving guidelines were defined broadly: grants were to be used for charitable, scientific or educational purposes. The Foundations areas of interest have evolved over the years and are now more narrowly defined. Current areas of funding include the environment, criminal justice, economic development, reproductive rights, and civil legal services.

In most program areas, the Foundation seeks to fund both direct services programs and advocacy efforts. The Foundations support for direct services programs is limited to those operating in New York City.
eligibility: Grants are made only to tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organizations.

The Foundation is currently reviewing its funding priorities and, as a result, is not accepting unsolicited letters of inquiry at this time. Feel free to contact our office if you have any questions.
