submission_info: LETTER OF INTENT 
Prospective applicants should submit a LOI online via RMS360 (http://jdrf.smartsimple.us) to be considered for a full proposal request. The LOI template provided on the RMS360 website must be used to complete the application. Applicants will be notified approximately eight weeks after the LOI deadline date if they have been approved to submit a full application.
Please see below for complete instructions. Letters of intent should use the template provided and include the following information:
? Background/rationale, published or preliminary data, hypotheses, specific aims, deliverables of project, collaborative framework if applicable
? Description of potential for translating project deliverables into therapies, including short and long-term development goals
? Indication of whether research will include human subjects
? Intellectual property or commercial efforts associated with the current application
? Estimated budget (total and yearly)

PROPOSAL 
An approved LOI is required prior to submission of a full proposal. Upon notification of a request for a full proposal, the application must be completed using the templates provided on the RMS360

description: PURPOSE

JDRF is committed to the development of novel therapies to improve metabolic control in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Toward this goal, JDRF invites applications to pursue preclinical or clinical studies to identify or validate novel targets for T1D metabolic control. Additionally, we invite applications to pursue clinical investigation of T1D pathophysiology toward the future identification and validation of novel targets.

BACKGROUND

T1D is characterized by the loss of insulin-producing beta cells and consequential metabolic sequela induced by high levels of blood glucose. Insulin therapy, while absolutely essential, is insufficient for most people with T1D to achieve optimal glycemic control and other metabolic outcomes. Thus, adjunct therapies that complement insulin action are critical. Although some validated type 2 diabetes (T2D) drugs (such as GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT inhibitors) show clinical efficacy in T1D, additional therapies designed specifically for T1D pathophysiology promise further advances in metabolic control. This RFA is intended to advance the development of adjunctive therapies rooted in T1D biology.
eligibility: Applications may be submitted by domestic and foreign non-profit organizations, public and private, such as universities, colleges, hospitals, laboratories, units of state and local governments, and eligible agencies of the federal government. Applicants must hold an M.D., D.M.D., D.V.M., Ph.D., or equivalent and have a faculty position or equivalent at a college, university, medical school, or other research facility. Please note that applications from for-profit entities or industry collaborations with academia may be submitted to this RFA; however, additional information will be requested from for-profit entities if a full application is invited.

There are no citizenship requirements for this program. To assure continued excellence and diversity among applicants and awardees, JDRF welcomes applications from all qualified individuals and encourages applications from persons with disabilities, women, and members of minority groups underrepresented in the sciences.
