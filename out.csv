The overarching goal of the Education Crisis Response is to: Expand enrollment in appropriate, protective and relevant educational options for the girls, boys, and youth that are affected by violence in Northeastern Nigeria.Activities will provide targeted assistance for the girls, boys, and youth that are affected by violence in Northeastern Nigeria, and ensure that children and youth have continued access to an instructional routine in Adamawa and the buffer States of Bauchi and Gombe (with other States to be determined as needs require and conditions permit). Within this goal, the Education Crisis Response will address the following problems: Expected large increase in drop-out rates in affected States Over-crowding of classrooms and learning spaces due to influx of displaced populations Limited access for displaced children Shortage of qualified teachers and instructional materials for formal and non-formal education Children traumatized by violence and abductions, and families fear of sending their children to school Marginalization of girls and children with disabilities Rising tensions between host communities and displaced populations.Programs may have a maximum duration of 36 months. Priority will be given to applications that can be launched rapidly. USAID anticipates awarding approximately two to six awards ranging anywhere from minimum grant size of $300,000 and a maximum grant size of $15,000,000 made available either to one grantee, multiple grantees, or no grantees depending on the quality of the applications and availability of funds.Subject to the availability of funds, USAID intends to provide the funding in the total range of approximately $30,000,000.

RMYF Innovation Grants support young organizations develop, test and, hopefully, eventually prove the effectiveness of untested, uncommon and otherwise unconventional services to help underprivileged youth reach their full potential.

These grants range from $5,000 to $20,000.","ELIGIBLE PROGRAMS

RMYF seeks to support programs that:

* Are innovative and have a potentially replicable service concept.
* Are offered by small or medium nonprofit organizations (operating budget of up to $1 million).
* Promote scholastic, professional, athletic and/or other excellence in disadvantaged youth (0-25 years old).
* Provide youth with new opportunities for health, personal growth and success.
* Are located in the greater metropolitan areas of Boston, Los Angeles, Milwaukee, San Francisco and Washington, DC. Search below to see if your zip code falls within our range.

ELIGIBLE ORGANIZATIONS

Innovation Grants aim to help undiscovered organizations at a point in their evolution where $20,000 still makes a meaningful contribution towards becoming sustainable long-term. If your organization has more than $1million in annual revenue or receive any grants over $100,000 from government entities or large philanthropic organizations, it has likely outgrown RMYF grants.

Only organizations that meet all of the following criteria are eligible for Innovation Grants:

- Are US-based organizations with IRS nonprofit status.
- Operate in one of these geographic areas: Boston MA, Los Angeles, CA, Milwaukee WI, San Francisco CA, and Washington DC.
- Offer innovative programs or services designed help underprivileged youth reach their full potential. Innovative is defined as ""uncommon, untested or otherwise unconventional"" In other words, RMYF funds programs or services that are outside of current customary practices. Innovative services RMYF has funded include the following:
- Credit union savings projects
- An intensive weekend tutoring program for at-risk students
- Book club for incarcerated youth that uses reading and writing to help them to envision a future that does not end with a cycle of incarceration or early death
- Neighborhood tour guide program
- Yoga program that works with the entire school community to create a less stressful and more mindful school learning environment
- A program that provides talented, experienced teachers with support, incentives and a professional environment to help make teaching in low-performing schools a viable long-term employment option
- Civic engagement after-school program in Spanish that includes an English language learning component.

Increased Access to Capital
We aim to influence the flow of financial capital to better meet the business growth needs within communities of color.

Reformed Procurement Practices
We aim to accelerate the growth of existing and established businesses owned by people of color by making opportunities to attain contracts with public agencies, anchor institutions and other large entities more accessible.

Improved Business Support Systems
We aim to strengthen the effectiveness, accessibility, and capacity of support networks available for business owners and entrepreneurs of color.

We believe that increasing the number and percent of stable and established firms owned by people of color will lead to the longer-term outcomes of greater income, stronger influence, and wealth creation for these communities, enabling them to more fully participate in the economy.

To achieve these outcomes, we aim to increase the amount of capital that people of color-owned firms can access, as well as explore opportunities to change the racial and gender dynamic of investors. This aspect of our strategy is critical, because despite founders of color having high-potential business models, they are commonly overlooked for growth capital often due to implicit biases and a lack of cultural understanding of their products and potential markets.

We will target anchor institution strategies, corporate initiatives and shifts in government policy that create more opportunities for firms owned by people of color to generate revenue and scale operations. Additionally, we continue to value targeted support systems for people of color that nurture entrepreneurs growth through mentors, capital, skill development and information.","We accept letters of inquiry from nonprofit organizations that believe there is strong alignment between their work and Surdnas funding priorities.

__ Selection Criteria

Improvements to Investing
We will support efforts that change the lens through which investment decisions are made and will explore opportunities to change the racial and gender dynamic of investors by supporting early-stage fund managers of color and funding leadership development opportunities designed to diversify the finance sector.

Inclusive Institutional Change
We will support initiatives that aim to shift the policies that guide procurement within large institutions to be more inclusive.

Professional Development Programs

JDRF is committed to the development of beta cell replacement therapies to restore glycemic control and eliminate the need for exogenous insulin administration in people with T1D. Pancreatic islet transplantation has been efficacious in improving metabolic control, preventing severe hypoglycemia, and improving quality of life in patients with medically unstable T1D. Despite significant progress in the development of alternative renewable sources of insulin producing cells to overcome the shortage of donor tissue, major scientific and technical challenges remain that must be addressed before beta cell replacement is widely incorporated into the clinical management of established T1D. One key limitation is the need for systemic administration of immunosuppressive drugs to protect the cell graft from the recipients immune response.

BACKGROUND

The advent of the Edmonton protocol signified a major breakthrough in clinical islet transplantation by significantly improving outcomes in patients that underwent the procedure as reflected by stable glycemia, reduction in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and elimination of hypoglycemia for several years.1,2 However, most of these patients still failed to maintain insulin independence for more than 5 years due to graft failure. Moreover, the use of immunosuppressive drugs is associated with serious adverse side effects and can impair beta cell function.3-5 Alternative approaches being explored for providing immune protection include encapsulation of cells in permselective membranes that allow exchange of nutrients, glucose, and insulin but block immune cells and other immune effectors from recognizing the graft.6-13 Although progress has been promising, the foreign body reaction and ensuing fibrotic encapsulation of implanted materials paired with limitations on mass transfer and nutrient delivery remain a challenge.

More recently, the emerging field of immuno-engineering has come to the forefront of efforts to develop technologies to control the patients innate and adaptive immune responses.14-24 These approaches employ various strategies targeting mechanisms of immune cell recognition and activation which could be exploited to direct the host response to implanted materials and/or cells towards a wound healing and/or tolerogenic response, as opposed to an inflammatory and/or effector response. Local immunomodulation at the graft site is highly desirable, as it could obviate the need for harsh and burdensome systemic immunosuppression regimens and perhaps even encapsulation barriers. Therefore, JDRF wishes to support research into novel strategies for localized modulation of the host response to implanted materials and development of immunomodulatory therapeutics to provide graft protection at the transplant site leading to long-term graft function.","ELIGIBILITY

JDRF is committed to the development of novel therapies to improve metabolic control in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Toward this goal, JDRF invites applications to pursue preclinical or clinical studies to identify or validate novel targets for T1D metabolic control. Additionally, we invite applications to pursue clinical investigation of T1D pathophysiology toward the future identification and validation of novel targets.

BACKGROUND

T1D is characterized by the loss of insulin-producing beta cells and consequential metabolic sequela induced by high levels of blood glucose. Insulin therapy, while absolutely essential, is insufficient for most people with T1D to achieve optimal glycemic control and other metabolic outcomes. Thus, adjunct therapies that complement insulin action are critical. Although some validated type 2 diabetes (T2D) drugs (such as GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT inhibitors) show clinical efficacy in T1D, additional therapies designed specifically for T1D pathophysiology promise further advances in metabolic control. This RFA is intended to advance the development of adjunctive therapies rooted in T1D biology.","Applications may be submitted by domestic and foreign non-profit organizations, public and private, such as universities, colleges, hospitals, laboratories, units of state and local governments, and eligible agencies of the federal government.

Background

The REACH Fund seeks to build the capacity of the nonprofit sector to address issues of racial and intersectional equity and inclusion and to address the gap between interest and capacity in the sector to pursue racial equity. The Fund will invest in supporting and lifting up the work of those who are innovating and developing promising practices.

By matching nonprofits with racial equity practitioners offering technical support on how to apply a racial equity lens towards dismantling institutional racism, build race conscious organizations and leadership, and design internal and external strategy, policy, and cultural change, the REACH Fund aims to:

help meet the increased demand and need from the nonprofit sector for technical support;
increase funding to support the being and doing of racial equity in the nonprofit and philanthropic sectors; and
create efficiency and opportunity for sharing the accelerators and barriers for sector level progress towards racial equity.
We believe that when nonprofits know where to go and how to move forward their own practice of racial equity, they will be better able to end inequities in their work.

The REACH Fund is a donor collaborative and learning community based at Borealis Philanthropy and currently includes support from the Barr Foundation, the Bush Foundation, the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, the Evelyn and Walter Haas, Jr. Fund, the Ford Foundation, the Grove Foundation, the Heising-Simons Foundation, the James Irvine Foundation, the Meyer Memorial Trust, the NoVo Foundation, the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation, and the S.D. Bechtel, Jr. Foundation.

The REACH Fund is one component of our racial equity work at Borealis Philanthropy. While the REACH Fund focuses on the nonprofit sector, the Racial Equity in Philanthropy (REP) Fund focuses on changing grantmaker behavior. The REP Funds vision is to promote grantmaking strategies that prioritize structural change and ending racial disparities as the norm in philanthropy. Visit the REP Fund page to learn more.

https://borealisphilanthropy.org/grantmaking/racial-equity-in-philanthropy-fund/

Grantmaking Model

The goal of the REACH Fund is to resource racial equity practitioners, the individuals and institutions working closely with nonprofit groups on the ground to advance their racial equity work internally and externally, and who are independent consultants  individual consultants, a team of individual consultants, capacity building organizations, or firms.

The REACH Funds three-part grantmaking strategy is:

Grants (combined program/general support) to racial equity practitioners.
Communities of practice  the collaborative would create opportunities for grantees and capacity builders to share lessons learned, strengthen their respective practice, and identify the ways in which the larger sector can benefit from this shared knowledge.
Communications  the collaborative would share lessons and knowledge for others undergoing racial equity work and share stories and case studies to make the case for philanthropy to provide greater support for this work.","Funding Priorities

The REACH Fund prioritizes investment in practitioners who have a body of work around racial equity by resourcing their time and expertise to develop and scale tools and strategies for the benefit of the nonprofit sector.

The Fund will directly resource practitioners to provide racial equity consultative services to nonprofit organizations. It will also support cross-sharing, learning and innovation among practitioners to lift up promising practices, case studies, strategies, frameworks and tools that facilitate nonprofits capacity to have greater impact on addressing racial inequities, internally in their organizations and externally in program and service delivery.","{""Urbanism"": {""Urban Studies"": {""Communities"": null}}, ""Business Administration"": {""Business or Industry"": {""Nonprofit Sector"": null}}}",,Business Administration;Business or Industry;Nonprofit Sector;Urbanism;Urban Studies;Communities,2018-11-14 03:01:52,0,,,https://borealisphilanthropy.org/grantmaking/racial-equity-to-accelerate-change-fund/,"

Level of funding:
 100,000 to  500,000 (up to  1 million in exceptional circumstances)

Duration of funding:
Up to 3 years","Who can apply
Climate Change and Health Awards are open to researchers who want to better understand the links between climate change and people's health.

The awards are open to individuals or teams of up to ten members from anywhere in the world. 

You can apply if you're based at:

an academic research organisation
a not-for-profit or government body
a private sector organisation.

Focus areas
To be eligible, your proposal must focus on at least one of the following areas:

1. Developing tools, data sources and other resources to support research into climate change and health 

To advance research into the links between climate change and health, it's important that researchers working across different disciplines and in different locations have access to high-quality tools, data sources and other resources.

Examples of activities we'll consider include (but are not limited to): 

-creating modelling tools to understand more about the links between climate change and health
-building, or establishing links between, datasets for climate change and health research
-translating, digitising and/or updating existing research and resources 
-producing or validating metrics that offer robust ways to track and evaluate the links between climate change and health.

Resources must be made openly available at the end of the funding. They should be applicable to a broad range of researchers carrying out climate and health research.

2. Assessing the health co-benefits of actions to mitigate climate change 

A growing number of studies have shown that actions to mitigate climate change can directly benefit people's health (ie they have 'health co-benefits').

For example, policies that encourage walking and cycling rather than driving will reduce greenhouse gas emissions. At the same time, these policies benefit health by improving air quality, increasing physical activity and reducing car crashes. Such insights can help inform climate change mitigation actions.

We are interested in proposals that assess how existing or hypothetical climate change mitigation actions could benefit health. These benefits could be expressed in health terms, monetary terms, or in other ways.

Mitigation actions can apply to any sector, including energy production, transportation, architecture, urban design and food systems. 

Proposals can focus on one or more mitigation actions, anywhere in the world.

3. Assessing the health impacts of actions to adapt to climate change 

Climate change poses many threats to human health, from severe weather and infectious disease risks to disrupted food systems and population displacement. To manage these threats, we'll need to adapt to climate change in many areas, including infrastructure, governance and technology.

Assessing the health impacts of adaptation actions - such as early warning systems for extreme weather, or drought-tolerant crops - is still an emerging field. 

We're especially interested in proposals that evaluate the health impacts of existing adaptations, rather than hypothetical ones. 

Proposals can focus on one or more adaptation, anywhere in the world.
